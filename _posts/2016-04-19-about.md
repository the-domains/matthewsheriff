I'm an art director, multi-media designer, photographer, but most of all a visual storyteller. I'm also a team player, avid surfer, lover of art and all things related to nature and the outdoors. My undergraduate and graduate studies included media arts, photography, graphic communications and fine art. I'm well-versed in both cutting-edge digital media and old-school printing methods and yet continually learn new ways to be expressive and promote the user experience. I've designed interiors for Chiquita Brands and Electrolux Corporate headquarters and neckties for Ben Silver, layouts for Williams-Sonoma and Restoration Hardware and Branded the Dig South Interactive Festival. My projects encompass everything from small businesses to international corporations. No matter the scale, I always envision the same goal: to find solutions and produce something that seamlessly and effectively communicates my client's vision, whether that's branding, event marketing, packaging, user experience, conceptual art or environmental design. I'm a graphic artist experienced with a large variety of local, regional, national and international brands. My work ethic mixed with a diverse set of skills make me unique. I believe in order to find great solutions, ideas must come from a combination of perspective, preparation and genuine belief in the cause. My strongest attribute is the ability to listen and find solutions, not only for the creative approach, but the marketing strategy. I've produced communications across a variety of media and know how to get the most from the creative process and budget. I began my career as a photographer and have migrated my talents to work in environmental, interactive, print, outdoor and broadcast.
